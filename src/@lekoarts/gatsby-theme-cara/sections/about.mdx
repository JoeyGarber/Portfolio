## About

Coding is an absolute pleasure, and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to pursue it for a living. I'm a junior developer right now, but I have a strong foundation, a high ceiling, a hunger to improve, and 10+ years of experience Googling answers to my questions. I'm creative, I welcome feedback, and I pride myself on being a reliable, flexible teammate.
